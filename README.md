# Airport Assistant
GitHub repository for our team project at the American Airlines BESMART hackathon. This will be a go-to logistics app for all airport occupants and will help minimize contact during airport operations by implementing features like in-airport food delivery, airport map/guide, virtual customer assistant, etc.

## Proposed Technologies
- Figma for clickable prototype
- Swift for mobile app
- Node.js API
- Google Maps
- Mastercard for payments
- Mongodb database
